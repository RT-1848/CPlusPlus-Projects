## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation and Execution

To compile and run any of the projects:

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd ProjectName
   ```
   
2. **Compile the project using** `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ *.cpp *.h
   ```
   
3. **Run the executable**:
   ```bash
   ./a.out
   ```

These projects were developed for educational purposes and may not fully follow professional software development standards. They serve as a reflection of my learning journey in C++ programming.
